Plot
Naina Talwar is a medical student absorbed in her studies. She tops her classes but feels like an outcast due to her introverted nature. An encounter with an old classmate, Aditi Mehra, makes her realize that she wants more from life than high marks. Thus, she makes an impulsive decision to follow Aditi on a hiking trip into the Himalayas, up to Manali. During the hike, she renews her friendship with other former classmates, Kabir "Bunny" Thapar and Avinash "Avi" Shiv. Bunny is a charmer whose dream is to wander and discover the world and has no interest in ever settling down, while Avi is a playboy who is addicted to alcohol and betting.

Throughout the trek, Bunny and Naina grow closer. One night, the two climb a mountain and Naina sees a new side of Bunny, causing her to grow feelings for him. Meanwhile, Aditi grows jealous of Preeti, one of their acquaintances, as Avi flirts with her a lot. Bunny and Naina realize that Aditi has feelings for Avi, but keep quiet. At the end of the trip, Naina is close to telling Bunny that she has feelings for him, but is interrupted by Avi who reveals that Bunny has been accepted into the school of journalism at Northwestern University in Chicago. Naina realizes that love and marriage have no part in Bunny's plans and remains silent but is happy for him as he is following his passion.

Eight years later, Naina has finished medical school and is now working in a clinic. Bunny works as a videographer for a travel show on FOX Network, hosted by his colleague Riana Sarai, and travels the world as he had always wanted. He receives an offer from Riana, who now has become a good friend of his, to become a host for a new travel show, which he accepts. He also receives a wedding invitation from Aditi, informing him that she is marrying a wealthy engineer, Taran Khanna. Bunny comes to Rajasthan for Aditi's destination wedding, and while the girls are happy to see him, Avi acts repulsive since Bunny avoided his calls and never bothered to stay in touch with him. Later, in a conversation with Naina, Bunny reveals that his father Sanjay had passed away and since he had been on a trek in a no-network zone, he couldn't make it to Sanjay's last rites.

Naina and Bunny spend time together, and Naina's feelings for Bunny grow once again, and Bunny too finds himself becoming attracted to Naina. However, she doesn't want to get her heart broken again, leading herself to avoid hanging out with Bunny. Later, Bunny sees Aditi fighting with Taran, and thinks they were fighting because Taran was jealous of Avi and Aditi. But Aditi reassures Bunny it was because she wanted to slap Avi for splurging excessively on booze and poker, while Taran paid it all off and was trying to stop her from insulting Avi. Bunny asks Aditi about her crush on Avi, but she says that she has gotten over him and is much happier with Taran. Bunny then realizes that he feels the same way about Naina and goes to see her with two drinks in his hand. Bunny sees Naina with another man, Naina's friend Vikram, and feels jealous, causing Bunny and Naina to argue. While in the midst of arguing Naina tells Bunny that she can't keep on hanging out with him, because she will fall in love with him again, and he won't again. Bunny eventually comes closer to Naina and kisses her. Afterwards, Bunny and Naina admit they love each other, but neither is willing to give up a career to follow the other. Naina says she is happy staying with her family, living her simple life and doesn't want to leave whereas Bunny wants to always be on the move and see the world. Naina decides that it's best that they forget each other, and they embrace each other in a tearful goodbye.

On the night of Aditi's wedding, Bunny leaves for Paris. At the airport, he realizes the importance of what he is leaving behind and instead goes to his home, where he reconciles with his stepmother Shivani. On New Year's Eve, Naina, alone at home, receives a surprise visit from Bunny. He explains he has turned down his dream job to be with her and proposes spontaneously, but Naina fears that he might regret his decision later. Bunny counters that he is happy with her and wants to continue travelling – but with her, arguing that somehow they can make a life together. Naina concedes, and they have a conference call with Aditi and Avi. Aditi and Avi are happy to know that Naina and Bunny are together, and they all are having a great phone call together. They all wish each other Happy New Year and the film ends with Bunny and Naina embracing.
